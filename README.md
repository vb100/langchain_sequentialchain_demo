<h2>SequentialChain with LangChain (video inside)</h2>

<p>
Sequential chains consist of steps where each step takes one input and produces one output. It is one of the most popular #LLM variant in #LangChain.
</p>

<p>In Sequential chains, the output from one step becomes the input for the next. You can simply setup individual chains, define input and output for them and combine them all into logical structure with LangChain.</p>

<p>This tutorial covers both some theory and hands-on practice, so it can be useful either for beginner and advanced user in Large Language Models developing. The whole code is written in purely Python.</p>

<p>As the main LLM framework we used here in the video, is OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo (the current version of #chatgpt ). With this video we will develop a logical sequential chain which takes an input the employee's performance review, and delivers the output as personalized plan forr improvement based on summarized employee's weaknesses. That is almost real-life example you go deeper with this tutorial.</p>
